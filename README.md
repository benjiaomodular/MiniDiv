## Versions
#### v0.3 - Fixed LED clearance issue
- To address LED clearance issues, I moved the LEDs to be mounted to the back, facing down, such that the LED shines through a hole on the board.

#### v0.2 - Initial release
- First working version
- ISSUE: The LEDs were preventing the jacks from going in completly. The module still works but it might cause problems in the future.
